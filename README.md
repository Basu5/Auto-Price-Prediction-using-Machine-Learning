# 🚗 Auto Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting the price of automobiles based on various features such as engine size, horsepower, brand, fuel type, and body style using regression models.

The dataset used is **Auto Imports Dataset** from UCI Machine Learning Repository, which contains technical specifications and pricing details of different car models.

## 📊 Project Overview

The goal is to build a robust Machine Learning model that can accurately predict car prices. This includes:

- 🧼 Data Cleaning (handling missing values, duplicate entries)
- 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover insights
- 🔧 Feature Engineering and Encoding
- ⚙️ Model Building with multiple regression techniques
- 🧪 Model Evaluation using regression metrics

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## 🛠️ Key Steps in the Project

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing values using mean, mode, and imputation techniques
- Converted categorical variables using Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding
- Detected and treated outliers using IQR method

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized distributions, correlations, and patterns using:
  - Heatmaps
  - Pairplots
  - Boxplots

### 3. Feature Engineering
- Derived and selected relevant features affecting price
- Scaled features using StandardScaler

### 4. Model Building
- Implemented multiple models:
  - Linear Regression
  - Ridge Regression
  - Lasso Regression
- Split the dataset using train-test split

### 5. Model Evaluation
- Used metrics:
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
  - R² Score

## 📌 Results

The Ridge Regression model provided the most consistent performance with a high R² score, showing its effectiveness in handling multicollinearity and improving prediction accuracy.
